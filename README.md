# Homework Summary

## This assignment had me performing code refactoring into a more Semantic HTML format.  I started removing all the <div> elements for more meaningful Semantic ones like <header>, <footer>, <main>, <section>.  I had to make some changes to the css to match the changes in HTML.  I changed the .footer and .header class selectors to regular element selectors.  I switched <div> to <section> to match.  In the css I was able to comnbine several class selectors together to shorten the css stack.  I also added alt attributes to the <img> element in the HTML to give the images a description.
